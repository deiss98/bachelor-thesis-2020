Programming an API for reading identity documents: case of the Benin national identity card
# Abstract
The optical character recognition technique, which has been widely used in commercial applica-
tions since the 1970s, now automates tasks such as passport processing, secure document processing
(cheques, financial documents, invoices), postal tracking, publishing, packaging of consumer goods
(batch codes, package codes, expiry dates) and clinical applications. Readers and ocr software can
be used, as well as intelligent cameras and industrial vision systems offering additional capabilities
such as bar code reading and product inspection. With the evolution of the web and applications
several techniques have been born in particular the APIs allowing thus through distributed architec-
tures to offer functionalities to other applications and to exchange data. Thus, through this project
we have setup a REST API to extract the information from the national identity card in order to allow
the developer to have this functionality in their various projects. From UML modeling to Node.js im-
plementation our service communicates with a MySQL database and uses the powerful Tesseract.js
optical character recognition engine for data extraction.
##Key words: OCR, API, REST, Batch codes, Industrial vision.
